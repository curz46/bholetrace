REQUIREMENTS

Install these on your machine before attempting to build BHOLETRACE.

* freeglut3-dev (glut)
* libglew-dev (glew)

BUILDING

git submodule update --init --recursive # pull lib/glm
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/bhole # to run

KEYBINDS

* WASD to rotate camera
* UP/DOWN arrow keys to increase/decrease orbit radius
* Z to enumerate over skyboxes (nebula takes a while to load, give it some time)
* R to enumerate over orbit speeds
* L to toggle on/off deflection of light

CREDITS

* Luca Bertozzi (https://github.com/ekardnam)

Very kindly solved the Binet equation differential for use in integration.

* https://github.com/blottn/opengl-quickstart/blob/master/main.cpp

Used as a reference for initial GLEW/shader boilerplate.

* https://github.com/Hirevo/OpenGL-Raytracer

Used as a reference for rotation logic to do with raytracing. Helped with the
concept of using a transfer texture to allow compute shaders to render to the
screen.

* https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h (image loading)
